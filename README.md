<h1>Sustainable Water Development in Chennai</h1>


<h3>Overview</h3>
Water scarcity is a significant issue in Chennai due to rapid urbanization, climate change, and poor water management. This project employs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), regression models, and machine learning techniques (ARIMA) to analyze historical data and predict future water availability trends.

<h3>Key Features</h3>
✅ Data Analysis – Visualization of water availability trends using graphs, charts, and maps.
✅ Predictive Modeling – ARIMA model for forecasting rainfall and reservoir levels.
✅ Water Quality Analysis – Assessing parameters like pH, hardness, and total dissolved solids.
✅ Sustainable Water Management Strategies – Policy recommendations based on findings.

<h3>Dataset</h3>
The dataset includes historical data on:

🌧️ Rainfall patterns (2010-2021)
💧 Reservoir storage levels (2004-2021)
🏞️ Groundwater availability
♻️ Sewage treatment capacity
🧪 Water quality indicators

<h3>Results & Findings</h3>
📌 Rainfall Patterns – Most rainfall occurs from October to December, with peaks in November.
📌 Reservoir Levels – Chembarambakkam and Redhills reservoirs contribute ~75% of Chennai's water supply.
📌 Water Quality – High variation in pH, hardness, and total dissolved solids across sources.
📌 Predictive Modeling – Forecasts for 2024 indicate potential stress on water availability if current trends continue.

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
🚀 Incorporating real-time data for improved model accuracy.
🚀 Expanding the scope to include wastewater management and groundwater recharge.
🚀 Applying deep learning models for enhanced forecasting.
